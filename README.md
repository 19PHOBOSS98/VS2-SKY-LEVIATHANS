## LOADING INTO THE DEMO MAPS
1. Download and install the following maps:
2. Initialize Leviathan Drones
   
    Once you load in to the world, you should have two Computercraft:Pocket Computers in your hotbar. The one with ID:0 is your controller and the other one with ID:1 is your debugger.
    Run `debugger_leviathan.lua` on the debugger and press 't' on your keyboard to (re)initialize the drones.
   
4. Unpause Head-Drone (TRACER)

   On your controller pocket computer run `swarm_controller.lua`. The swarm controller UI should appear. You can configure each of the drone by clicking on one of their IDs on the list on the left side of the screen. The list is arranged from top to bottom starting with the head-drone (Drone ID:16).

   All drones are paused by default. We need to set them to `RUN` to get them to move.

   Unpause the head-drone first. Click on it's Drone ID and toggle the `PAUSE` button. The head-drone should start positioning itself to the starting position.

   
5. Unpause Segment Drone (SEGMENT)

   Next we need to unpause the segment-drones. We can go thru the list one by one to unpause them all but we can configure them all at once from the `ALL` tab.

   Click the `ALL` button on the top left to bring up the Swarm Controls. We can switch thru the different types of drones to configure by clicking on the Drone-Type button. By default it should start with `Turret`
